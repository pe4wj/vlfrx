VLF receiver for the Teensy MCU + audio shield.

Having visited Grimeton radio station (SAQ) in Sweden in August 2019, I came up with the idea to build a dedicated receiver.

Inspired by SAQRX by SM6LKM (https://sites.google.com/site/sm6lkm/saqrx/) but I did not want to use the PC for this. Instead, I opted for using a Teensy MCU and its companion audio shield.

Instead of using complex low pass filters as done in SAQRX, the complex multiplication is done after the I and Q filters. This is essentially Weaver's method of single sideband demodulation.

The signal processing code has been generated by the excellent Teensy Audio System Design tool (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/)
